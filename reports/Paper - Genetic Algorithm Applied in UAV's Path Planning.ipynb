    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft that does not carry a human operator, and it can be piloted remotely or even fly autonomously [1]. There is a broad interest in the development of better, faster and more useful UAV systems. These systems are being used in a series of applications such as field recognizance, agricultural surveying, disaster assistance, law enforcement and others [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the development of UAV systems is still complex\n",
    "and requires more practical and theoretical experience to\n",
    "mature the UVA’s flights safe. Regulatory laws regarding the\n",
    "safe use of UAV are being defined in many countries, usually\n",
    "following standards from international organizations such as\n",
    "the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United States; the\n",
    "Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), Australia and the\n",
    "European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Europe Union [3].\n",
    "These rules define patterns for a safe flight and how to achieve\n",
    "it regarding the safety of people and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous control systems use techniques from the field\n",
    "of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve autonomy [4], and it is\n",
    "a relevant tool to mitigate problems for complex systems such\n",
    "as those embedded in UAVs. An autonomous UAV system\n",
    "can sometimes fly safer, execute tasks quicker and preciser\n",
    "than operated by human pilots. For many UAV applications,\n",
    "its remote operation by human pilots can be either expensive\n",
    "or impracticable [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "The automation can be divided into three main categories:\n",
    "(i) not autonomous - the UAV system needs to be operated\n",
    "by a human and does not perform any movement actions by\n",
    "itself; (ii) semi-autonomous - the system has some elements\n",
    "that facilitate the flight, such as stabilizers, autopilots and\n",
    "previously coded actions (e.g., return to land); (iii) autonomous - the system can complete a given mission without human\n",
    "interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present paper introduces a solution to make the UAV\n",

    "path. This research mainly investigates a couple of ways to\n",
    "address the path planning problem with risk allocation and\n",
    "obstacle avoidance, while taking care of optimizing the fuel\n",
    "consumption and other resources. Two main constraints are\n",
    "handled. First, the system must work within a non-convex\n",
    "environment, which means to deal with obstacle avoidance.\n",
    "Second, the system must work embedded in the UAV that\n",
    "leads to online path planning and replanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we introduce a hybrid evolutionary algorithm integrating a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to Ray Casting\n",
    "(RC) algorithm [6] for obstacle avoidance. RC allows solving\n",
    "problems in 3D computer graphics and computational geometry using ray-surface intersection tests. The proposed method\n",
    "is evaluated by running under a Raspberry Pi board to planning\n",
    "paths for a set of benchmark maps introduced in [7].\n",

    "Mission and path planning approaches are described by\n",
    "[8]–[11]. A planning system is described in [8] for discrete\n",

    "underwater vehicles. The planner provides autonomy by giving\n",
    "the system a decision-making module that uses a compact\n",

    "mathematical formulation to define the set of actions that can\n",

    "\n",
    "The problem approached by this paper is based on a similar\n",
    "one described in [9], named as Chance-Constrained Optimal\n",
    "Path Planning with Obstacles. The problem is formulated\n",
    "using stochastic models to describe the chance-constraints for\n",
    "risk allocation when planning the trajectories. Mathematical\n",
    "programming based heuristics are proposed that return paths\n",
    "based on upper and lower bound solutions from the stochastic\n",
    "model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors in [10] extend the chance-constrained approach\n",
    "to continuous time where the risk is bounded from the reflection principle since the trajectory follows a Brownian motion.\n",
    "A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is\n",
    "proposed in [11] for the same problem, which was able to\n",
    "solve more complex maps within a reduced computational time\n",
    "using an exact method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolutionary algorithms have been applied to solve\n",
    "path planning problems, as described in [12]–[15]. A hybrid\n",
    "method combining genetic algorithms with Voronoi diagrams\n",
    "is introduced by [12], where the Voronoi approach helps to\n",
    "create the GA population aiming to improve the overall quality\n",
    "of solutions. GA is applied in [13] for path planning of mobile\n",
    "robots with obstacle avoidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid algorithm is proposed in [14] that combines\n",
    "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and GA for path planning\n",
    "in mobile robots with obstacle avoidance. ACO returns an\n",
    "initial trajectory which is improved by GA. The aircraft in\n",
    "[15] must avoid no-fly zones, radars zones, missiles, and\n",
    "anti-aircraft guns. A three-dimensional scenario is assumed,\n",
    "and a Differential Evolution (DE) method is proposed for\n",
    "path planning. The robustness and convergence speed of DE\n",
    "outperforms 11 other algorithms from the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hybrid method combines a multi-population genetic algorithm with the resolution of a linear programming model in\n",
    "[16]. A non-convex environment with uncertainties is assumed,\n",
    "and a visibility graph helps to encode all possible paths as\n",
    "individuals. A linear programming model is solved from such\n",
    "encoding, and the solution achieved will define the fitness of\n",
    "the individual as well as a possible path to be executed.\n",
    "The path replanning problem for UAVs, under an emergency\n",
    "landing, is approached by [17]. The authors proposed three\n",
    "path planning methods: a greedy heuristic, a simple genetic\n",

    "\n",
    "The Ray Casting algorithm is applied during the fitness calculation to identify obstacles in Equation \\ref{eq:fit:obs} or landing areas in Equation \\ref{eq:fit:land}. As previously mentioned, this algorithm is widely used in computer graphics field, especially for rendering 3D scenes for games and animation movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "RC simulates the path a light ray makes when inserted on an environment, by calculating the trajectory of the ray from the light source until it reaches an object. Further developments on the Ray Casting simulated the reflex of objects and the projection of new rays. Given a 2D polygon and a point, a ray is cast from the point to the infinite. If this ray crosses an even number of the polygon's edge, the point is outside the polygon, if it crossed an odd number, then it is inside the polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the path planning problem, the Ray Casting algorithm is employed here to avoid collision with a no-fly area. This is done by casting horizontal rays from each waypoint of the route. Next, it is calculated how many times the ray cast intercepted the polygon formed by the area. If the ray intercepted the area an odd number, the waypoint is inside the area, if it intercepted an even number, then the waypoint is outside of the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray Casting algorithm implemented in this work consists of a two-fold algorithm. The first one, the \\emph{Point in Polygon} RC is used to check if a given polygon contains a point. This algorithm is employed by Equation \\ref{eq:fit:RC_P} and it uses the logic of casting a horizontal ray in the direction of the positive axis (i.e. to the right on Cartesian) and counts the number of areas edges intersections, establishing if it is inside or not the area. The \\emph{Point in Polygon} RC is used to check for every waypoint of the route the relational position colliding with any obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second RC is the \\emph{Segment intersects Segment}. This algorithm is important because the notion of waypoints is only an abstraction for the UAV's controller to trace a motion vector that drives the airship along some path. Due to that, it is not only necessary to check if the waypoints are colliding with obstacles but to check if any part of the UAV's route is colliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by checking the orientation of each segment of the route with each edge of the no-fly areas. For a pair of following waypoints belonging to the route, a ray is cast between them, i.e. a connection. It is then checked with the area's edges. If the orientation of the points indicates both segments intersect between themselves, the route is then penalized. Otherwise, the route does not receive a penalty when the segments are not intersecting. This is described by Equation \\ref{eq:fit:RC_S}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation \\ref{eq:fit:RC_L} is also related to the \\emph{Point in Polygon} RC. The goal of this equation is to check if the route's last waypoint, the landing point, arrived at a safe zone  or not, allowing the UAV to safely land. To verify if the point is contained inside the polygon formed by the safe zone, the Ray Casting algorithm is applied as described for the \\emph{Point in Polygon} RC. %In this case, instead of positive cost, making the solution worse, the method uses a negative cost, minimizing the fitness value, therefore, making the solution better, as intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the Ray Casting algorithm is not widely used for path planning and geophysical methods, a previous evaluation of the proposed algorithms was necessary. It was made a stress test over the algorithms, executing many cases and inspecting the results. First, the evaluation of checking if a given waypoint is inside a polygon used the algorithm \\emph{Point in Polygon}. The process selected a thousand points \\(\\omega\\) and assigned to them uniformly distributed values for its \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates, where the Equation \\ref{eq:res:pip} describes the process of selecting the coordinates.\n",

The label \"T\" stands for \\emph{True} along with the colour green, i.e. the point is \\textbf{inside} the polygon. The label \"F\" stands for \\emph{False} along with the colour purple, indicating that the point is \\textbf{outside} the area.

The novelty is the combination of genetic algorithm with Ray Casting algorithm to avoid obstacles and to find safe regions for an emergency landing. The path planning and replanning system, based on the proposed hybrid method, was executed with a Raspberry PI that can be embedded on the UAV. The method returned trajectories without hit any obstacles for all simulations done. For path planning, more than 90\\% of the trajectories reach the destination within the desired threshold, while a total of 84\\% trajectories landed the aircraft in safety regions. A reasonable amount of feasible solutions is found for both scenarios in less than 40 sec. The method is not compared against related approaches such as those proposed by \\cite{bow:2011,Arantes2016, daSilva2019collision} since these works solve linear models with exact approaches that do not run under Raspberry PI. As a future work, we will compare our approach against other planners for non-convex scenarios, based on methods such as A* or RRT. Also, we will evolve our hybrid GA to deal with 3D environments.\n",
